# Frontend Challenges

> Real-world challenges to improve your frontend development skills through practice...and to have fun! ðŸš€

These challenges are split up into different frontend areas. Each challenge _should_ contain a design, relevant assets to work with, and instructions.

Don't worry about being pixel perfect, or writing production-ready code. This is simply a chance to learn and have some fun!

Oh, and no tests either! ðŸŽ‰

### âœ¨ Animations

These challenges are aimed at flexing your animation skills, as well as learning about animation timings, chaining, and performance.
